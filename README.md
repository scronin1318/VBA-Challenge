# VBA-Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to calculate the total daily volume and return rate for each of the twelve stock tickers for each year (2017 and 2018) as efficiently as possible. By running this analysis, we can ascertain which stocks are the most profitable (by looking at return rates), as well as which stocks are most liquid (by looking at total daily volume), which can ultimately help us decide which stocks are worth investing in. Specifically in regards to VBA, our goal is to refactor code so that it runs quicker and more efficiently.  

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
